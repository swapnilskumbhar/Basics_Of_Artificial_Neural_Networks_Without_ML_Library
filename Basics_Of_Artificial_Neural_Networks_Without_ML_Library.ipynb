    "# Basics Of Artificial Neural Networks Without ML Library\n",
    "We as species learnt many things, achieved many things. We were living in caves, hunting animals, walking naked and look at us now we are most advanced civilization that ever lived on this planet and may colonize other planets in near future. From invention of the wheel, farming to the invention of artificial intelligence we have achived great many things. Through all this journey humans have most biologically advanced,complex computer with humans and that is our brain. As our last invention we want to mimic same behaviour as our brain into the machines, so we started studying our own brain and it turned out that the neuron is the basic working unit of the brain and brain has almost 100 billion of them. We created the models of mathematics which will represent the behaviour/pattern observed in our brain. Those models are known as artificial neural networks. After experimenting with different approaches we have created network of neurons that have multiple layers that is known as deep neural networks."

    "Generally the artifial neural network consists of layers of the above neurons. The layer which takes input is known as input layer similarly output layer gives the output. If you have output which is linear function of the input then those two layers are enough but if you have output which is non linear function of input then you should introduce the layers of neurons between the input layer and output layer. These layers are known as hidden layers and if one network have hidden more than one hidden layer then that network is known as deep neural network. If we have enough hidden layers then we can map any function using the neural network thus neural network follows the Universal Approximation Theorem.  "

So if we take the derivative of the error function by putting the values of current parameters of our networks then we get the slope of the line which is tangent to the error function and by using that slope, we know whether to increase or decrease the values of our parameters in order to decrease the error value."
